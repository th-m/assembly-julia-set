<p>In this step you will change your <code>run</code> function to write a single
row of pixels to the output file in addition to the header that you
wrote earlier.</p>

<h2>What to write</h2>

<p>For this first step, you will create a file, write a header to it,
generate a single row of pixels with a gradient pattern, write it to
the file, close the file, and then return.</p>

<p>Your code should implement this pseudo-code:</p>

<pre><code>fd = open(filename, flags, mode)
if fd &lt; 0: return fail_open

# write the header
length = writeHeader(buffer, xsize, ysize)
status = write(fd, buffer, length)
if status &lt; 0: return fail_writeheader

# write a single row of pixels
length = 0
for column in range(xsize):
    color = column &lt;&lt; 8
    length += writeRGB(buffer+length, color)
    buffer[length] = &#39; &#39;
    length += 1

# replace last space with a newline
buffer[length-1] = &#39;\n&#39;
status = write(fd, buffer, length)
if status &lt; 0: return fail_writerow

# close the file
status = close(fd)
if status &lt; 0: return fail_close
return 0
</code></pre>
